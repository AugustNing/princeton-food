# August's Princeton Food List

A list of restaurants that I like near/around Princeton NJ (and NYC??), written from a stingy grad student with no car perspective. There are some comments. The first paragraph is an overview of Grocery stores, alcohol, and free food at Princeton. 

I make no guarantees if any of these are that good since im no foodie lol, but I think they are pretty good if they make the list. Some of them are also suggested by trusted friends who eat out more than I do.

I want to note that COS Lecturer Kevin Wayne has a much more extensive list than I do, and I think he writes more coherently than I do: [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/princeton.restaurants/](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/princeton.restaurants/)

The list is in no way comprehensive, so use this as a good starting point and let me know if you find anywhere good. Suggestions? Feel free to make a pull request or email me!
