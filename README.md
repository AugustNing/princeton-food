# August's Princeton Food List

**If you have suggestions for Philly please feel free to make an issue so I can add it in!** I sadly haven't gone to Philly yet :cry:

A list of restaurants that I like near/around Princeton NJ (and NYC??), written from a stingy grad student with no car perspective. There are some comments. The first paragraph is an overview of grocery stores, alcohol, and free food/stuff at Princeton.

I make no guarantees if any of these are that good since im no foodie lol, but I think they are pretty good if they make the list. Some of them are also suggested by trusted friends who eat out more than I do.

I want to note that COS Lecturer Kevin Wayne has a much more extensive list than I do, and I think he writes more coherently than I do lol: [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/princeton.restaurants/](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/princeton.restaurants/)

The list is in no way comprehensive, so use this as a good starting point and let me know if you find anywhere good. Suggestions? Feel free to make an issue or a pull request.

The biggest grocery stores around here that you can get to on the weekend shopper are whole foods, wegmans, and trader joes. Nassau park (where wegmans is) also has a target, home depot/lowes, michaels. However taking the bus is really annoying so if you dont have a car, i recommend making friend with a car to drive you instead lol.

Within driving distance is also a Costco (:heart:). If you have a costco membership and a car, please take me.

If you want (east) asian groceries and can drive, there is Woo Ri mart (korean) in princeton junction near the dinky station and asian food mart (chinese) in plainsboro (10 min drive). If you want to go a larger store, there is an hmart (korean) and 99 ranch market (chinese) in edison (~30 min drive). I personally think asian grocery stores are cheaper for produce compared to wegmans. I also think the masking rate is higher in asian groceries compared to wegmans.

Patel Brothers in East Windsor i think is the closest indian grocery store

NJ alc thing: most restaurants are bring your own beer/beverages (BYOB) since most dont have the expensive liquor license. 

There’s some law in NJ where each company can only have two liquor licenses in the whole state. You can get most beers and liquor at the stores around campus, abet for a market up. Near equad is nassau liquors grape grain and varsity liquor. On witherspoon is public wine. 

Cheaper drinks can be found at the wegmans and trader joes on Route 1 (they conveniently these licenses). If you have a car, the costco in Edison has liquor. There isn’t liquor or beer at CVS, Wawa, 7Eleven,  etc. 

Subscribe to the freefood email list! During the school year you can practically live off this email list, no joke. Undergrads get a ton of free food.

During the year, there is usually a weekly GSG happy hour (previously have been on Wednesdays) that has dinner and beers! They are announced on weekly GSG emails. Dinner is usually pizza. Food goes quickly, so go in the first 15mins if you want to get food.

On Friday nights there is usually social hour in grad college courtyard or old grad college (OGC) common room. Open bar with snacks! Very popular at the beginning of the school year, not as popular a few weeks in.
